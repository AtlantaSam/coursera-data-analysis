# [Coursera] Data Analysis: Lecture Notes & Course Work

These are my notes, experiments, and coursework for the
[Data Analysis](https://class.coursera.org/dataanalysis-001/class/index) course
on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/), taught by
[Jeffrey Leek](http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~jleek/) (see also:
[Simply Statistics](http://simplystatistics.org/)). The one-liner description of
the course from the Coursera site:

> Learn about the most effective data analysis methods to solve problems and
> achieve insight.

## About this Repository

The course uses [R](http://www.r-project.org/) as the primary tool for
conducting data analyses. Leeks recommends using [R Studio](http://www.rstudio.com/),
and so do I. (Also: do yourself a favor and get R Studio set up to use
[R Markdown](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/docs/r_markdown).)

### A Note About Plagiarism

In December 2013, someone brought it to my attention the people were using these notes not to _help_ themselves in their learning process, but to _cheat_ and to _plagiarize_. I'd had high hopes that these would be useful and not harmful. But as the world is apparently full of cheating scumbags, I've had to remove the quizzes and assignments.
